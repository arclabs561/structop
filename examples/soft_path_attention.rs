//! End-to-end example: “DP = attention” on a tiny DAG.
//!
//! The `soft_shortest_path_edge_marginals` function returns edge marginals under a
//! Gibbs distribution over paths. These marginals are exactly the gradients of the
//! soft shortest-path value w.r.t. edge costs (Mensch & Blondel 2018 framing).

    // 0->1->3 (cheap) and 0->2->3 (expensive).
    //
    // The edge marginals returned by the DP are exactly the “soft attention”
    // weights over edges induced by a Gibbs distribution over paths.
