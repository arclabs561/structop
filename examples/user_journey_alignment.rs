//! User Journey Alignment Demo (Soft-DTW)
//!
//! Demonstrates using Soft-DTW to align noisy user sessions to a canonical "Golden Path".
//!
//! # The Scenario
//!
//! - **Golden Path**: `Landing -> Pricing -> Sign Up`
//! - **User A (Focused)**: `Landing -> Pricing -> Sign Up` (Perfect)
//! - **User B (Lost)**: `Landing -> Blog -> Pricing -> Blog -> Pricing -> Sign Up` (Noisy)
//! - **User C (Bounce)**: `Landing -> Blog -> Exit` (Incomplete)
//!
//! # Why Soft-DTW?
//!
//! Standard DTW is hard (min). Soft-DTW is differentiable and smooth.
//! This allows us to use the alignment score as a continuous feature for clustering
//! or churn prediction models.
